Most health systems manage the risk of transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) through a portfolio of blood safety interventions. These portfolios must be updated periodically to reflect shifting epidemiological conditions, emerging infectious diseases, and new technologies. However, the number of available blood safety portfolios grows exponentially with the number of available interventions, making it impossible for policymakers to evaluate all feasible portfolios without the assistance of a computer model. We develop a novel optimization model for evaluating blood safety portfolios that enables systematic comparison of all feasible portfolios of deferral, testing, and modification interventions to identify the portfolio that is preferred from a cost-utility perspective. We present structural properties that reduce the state space and required computation time in certain cases, and we develop a linear approximation of the model. We apply the model to retrospectively evaluate U.S. blood safety policies for Zika and West Nile virus for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, defining donor groups based on season and geography. We leverage structural properties to efficiently find an optimal solution. We find that the optimal portfolio varies geographically, seasonally, and over time. Additionally, we show that for this problem the approximated model yields the same optimal solution as the exact model. Our method enables systematic identification of the optimal blood safety portfolio in any setting and any time period, thereby supporting decision makers in efforts to ensure the safety of the blood supply.","tags":["Binary integer programming","Blood safety","Cost-effectiveness","Public health policy"],"title":"Optimal portfolios of blood safety interventions: test, defer or modify?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

Study Design and Methods: We developed a mathematical risk reduction model to estimate the impact of nationwide whole blood pathogen reduction in Ghana on the incidence of six infectious and one non-infectious transfusion-associated adverse events. We estimated the lifetime direct healthcare costs and disability-adjusted life years lost for each adverse event. For HIV, HCV, and HBV, we simulated disease progression using Markov models, accounting for the likelihood and timing of clinical detection and treatment. We performed probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analysis. Results: Adding whole blood pathogen reduction to Ghana's blood safety portfolio would avert an estimated 19,898 (11,948-27,353) adverse events and 38,491 (16,444-67,118) disability-adjusted life years annually, primarily by averting sepsis (49%) and malaria (31%) infections. One year of pathogen reduction would cost an estimated $8,037,191 ($6,381,946-$9,880,760) and eliminate $8,656,389 ($4,462,614-$13,469,448) in direct healthcare spending on transfusion-associated adverse events. We estimate a 58% probability that the addition of pathogen reduction would reduce overall direct healthcare spending. Findings were most sensitive to uncertainty in the probability that a bacterially contaminated blood donation causes sepsis. Conclusion: Whole blood pathogen reduction would substantially reduce the burden of known transfusion-associated adverse events in Ghana and may reduce overall healthcare spending. Additional benefits not captured by this analysis may include averting secondary transmission of infectious diseases, reducing non-medical costs, and averting new or re-emerging transfusion-transmitted infections.","tags":["FNHTR","HBV","HCV","HIV","WBPR","antiviral therapy","blood safety","cost-utility","febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction","hepatitis B","hepatitis C","human immunodeficiency virus","pathogen reduction","sub-Saharan Africa Abbreviations: AVT","whole blood pathogen reduction"],"title":"Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of whole blood pathogen reduction in Ghana","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

Countries have used various risk mitigation strategies, including travel bans and mandatory quarantine and testing. We developed a mathematical simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of quarantine and testing, alone and in combination, across a variety of scenarios. We found that quarantine was more effective than testing alone, even for quarantine as short as two days, and the value of adding testing to quarantine diminished for longer quarantine durations. Testing was most effective if performed near the end of quarantine, but testing upon arrival may be more effective in situations where compliance with later testing cannot be enforced. Compliance of travelers and the percent of infections that were asymptomatic greatly influenced policy effectiveness. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No funding specific to this publication was received.

We assessed how baseline determination impacted AKI incidence and association between AKI and clinical outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively applied empirical (measured serum creatinine) and imputed (age/height) baseline estimation methods to pediatric patients discharged between 2014 and 2019 from an academic hospital. Using each method, we estimated AKI incidence and assessed area under ROC curve (AUROC) for AKI as a predictor of three clinical outcomes: application of AKI billing code (proxy for more clinically overt disease), inpatient mortality, and post-hospitalization chronic kidney disease. Results: Incidence was highly variable across baseline methods (12.2–26.7%). Incidence was highest when lowest pre-admission creatinine was used if available and Schwartz bedside equation was used to impute one otherwise. AKI was more predictive of application of an AKI billing code when baseline was imputed universally, regardless of pre-admission values (AUROC 80.7–84.9%) than with any empirical approach (AUROC 64.5–76.6%). AKI was predictive of post-hospitalization CKD when using universal imputation baseline methods (AUROC 67.0–74.6%); AKI was not strongly predictive of post-hospitalization CKD when using empirical baseline methods (AUROC 46.4–58.5%). Baseline determination method did not affect the association between AKI and inpatient mortality. Conclusions: Method of baseline determination influences AKI incidence and association between AKI and clinical outcomes, illustrating the need for standard criteria. Imputing baseline for all patients, even when preadmission creatinine is available, may identify a more clinically relevant subset of the disease.","tags":["AKI","Acute kidney injury","Children","Epidemiology","Serum creatinine"],"title":"Baseline creatinine determination method impacts association between acute kidney injury and clinical outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathon R.

We defined active testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for groups at increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in all Canadian provinces. METHODS: We identified 5 groups who should be prioritized for active RT-PCR testing: contacts of people who are positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 4 at-risk populations - hospital employees, community health care workers and people in long-term care facilities, essential business employees, and schoolchildren and staff. We estimated costs, human resources and laboratory capacity required to test people in each group or to perform surveillance testing in random samples. RESULTS: During July 8-17, 2020, across all provinces in Canada, an average of 41 751 RT-PCR tests were performed daily; we estimated this required 5122 personnel and cost $2.4 million per day ($67.8 million per month). Systematic contact tracing and testing would increase personnel needs 1.2-fold and monthly costs to $78.9 million. Conducted over a month, testing all hospital employees would require 1823 additional personnel, costing $29.0 million; testing all community health care workers and persons in long-term care facilities would require 11 074 additional personnel and cost $124.8 million; and testing all essential employees would cost $321.7 million, requiring 25 965 added personnel. Testing the larger population within schools over 6 weeks would require 46 368 added personnel and cost $816.0 million. Interventions addressing inefficiencies, including saliva-based sampling and pooling samples, could reduce costs by 40% and personnel by 20%. Surveillance testing in population samples other than contacts would cost 5% of the cost of a universal approach to testing at-risk populations. INTERPRETATION: Active testing of groups at increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 appears feasible and would support the safe reopening of the economy and schools more broadly. This strategy also appears affordable compared with the $169.2 billion committed by the federal government as a response to the pandemic as of June 2020.","tags":null,"title":"Active testing of groups at increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in Canada: Costs and human resource needs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jessica X.

Though the complication rate after ER is lower than transanal surgery, recurrence is higher. Patients lost to follow up after ER might therefore be at increased risk for rectal cancer. We evaluated the costs, benefits, and cost effectiveness of ER compared to 2 surgical techniques for removing complex rectal polyps, using a 50-year time horizon—this allowed us to capture rates of cancer development among patients lost from follow-up surveillance. Methods: We created a Markov model to simulate the lifetime outcomes and costs of ER, transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), and transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) for the management of a complex benign rectal polyp. We assessed the effect of surveillance by allowing a portion of the patients to be lost to follow up. We calculated the cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or each intervention over a 50-year time horizon. Results: We found that TEM was slightly more effective than TAMIS and ER (TEM, 19.54 QALYs; TAMIS, 19.53 QALYs; and ER, 19.53 QALYs), but ER had a lower lifetime discounted cost (ER cost $7161, TEM cost $10,459, and TAMIS cost $11,253). TEM was not cost effective compared to ER, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $485,333/QALY. TAMIS was dominated by TEM. TEM became cost effective when the mortality from ER exceeded 0.63%, or if the loss to follow up rate exceeded 25.5%. Conclusions: Using a Markov model, we found that ER, TEM, and TAMIS have similar effectiveness, but ER is less expensive, in management of benign rectal polyps. As the rate of loss to follow up increases, transanal surgery becomes more effective relative to ER.","tags":["Adenoma","Endoscopy","ICER","Polypectomy"],"title":"Cost effectiveness of endoscopic resection vs transanal resection of complex benign rectal polyps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT in the first year of screening compared with alternatives for the 50 states and separately for Puerto Rico. Design: Microsimulation that captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients, sexual partners, and their infants. Data Sources: National testing results compiled by AABB and costs, utilities, and outcome probabilities estimated from the literature. Target Population: Transfusion recipients. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: Universal ID-NAT, universal mini-pool NAT (MP-NAT), and ID-NAT exclusively for components transfused to women of childbearing age. Seasonally targeted strategies in Puerto Rico and geographically targeted strategies in the 50 states were also considered. Outcome Measures: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and outcomes. Results of Base-Case Analysis: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT exclusively during high mosquito season was cost-effective at $81 123 per QALY (95% CI, $49 138 to $978 242 per QALY). No screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states. Universal ID-NAT cost $341 million per QALY (CI, $125 million to $2.90 billion per QALY) compared with no screening in the 50 states. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT only during the season of high mosquito activity was most cost-effective in 64% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis iterations. In the 50 states, no intervention was cost-effective in 99.99% of iterations. Cost-effectiveness was highly dependent on the rate of assumed infectious donations. Limitation: Data were limited on the component-specific trans-missibility of Zika and long-term sequelae of infection. Conclusion: Screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico, and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states.
