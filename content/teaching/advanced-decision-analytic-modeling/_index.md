## Course description

Advanced methods used to model health policy decisions and conduct model-based health technology assessment, both theory and technical applications. Methods covered include: Markov and microsimulation models, optimization, Bayesian model calibration and evaluation, probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and value of information analysis. Application areas include: disease screening, prevention, and treatment, prioritization of clinical research, and policies to avert drug overdose deaths.

**Prerequisites:** a course in probability, a course in statistics or biostatistics, a course on cost-effectiveness such as PPHS 528, and some programming experience (we will use R).
**Target audience:** The course is targeted towards PhD students and advanced Masters students interested in conducting model-based analyses of health policies and health technologies in research
