The Decision Modeling lab aims to enable the efficient and effective use of finite healthcare resources by developing data-driven analyses that inform health policy and clinical decisions. Our interdisciplinary research uses methods from decision analysis, simulation, health economics, operations research, and data science. Current projects include:

* Informing the use of blood donor data for population health surveillance
* Developing new methods to manage risk iron deficiency in blood donors based on individual donors' risk
* Assessing the impact of patient portal technology

We are part of the [McGill Clinical and Health Informatics Research Group](mchi.mcgill.ca) and the [McGill School of Population and Global Health](https://www.mcgill.ca/spgh/) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
