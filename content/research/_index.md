The Decision Modeling Lab's research informs health policy and clinical decisions through data-driven modeling and analysis. We use methods from decision science, optimization, epidemiology, health economics, and machine learning to enable the efficient, effective, and equitable utilization of resources. We collaborate with stakeholders in medicine and health policy to maximize our impact on policy and practice while extending the state of the art in data-driven decision modeling.

## Current projects

Currently funded projects include:

* Analyzing the operational impact of a patient portal with propensity score matching

* Assessing the public health value of blood donor data with Bayesian modeling

* Developing an individualized approach to managing risk of iron deficiency in repeat blood donors with machine learning + simulation

## Pending projects

Several **research projects that are pending funding decisions** will use methods from epidemiology, machine learning, health economics and mathematical modeling to inform decisions in health policy and clinical practice. Prospective group members should send an email to Alton with their CV so he can determine whether any of the pending projects are aligned with your interests.

## Open science research philospohy

Our group works hard to produce research that is informative, rigorous, transparent, and reproducible. [**The Decision Modeling Lab Manual**](https://bookdown.org/altonrus/lab_manual/) describes our approach to open research and dissemination.
