I'm a PhD student in the Quantitative Life Sciences program at McGill. Previously, I completed my MSc (Computer Science, 2022) and BSc (joint majoring in Biology and Computer Science, 2020) both at McGill. 

My project involves managing iron-related risks for repeated blood donors in order to enable data-driven policies to be made for each individual.

Outside of the lab and during my free time, I enjoy working out, trying new food, and dancing.
