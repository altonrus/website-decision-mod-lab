I graduated with BS of Statistics from Sichuan University and then I obtained MS in Applied Statistics in 2014, PhD in Statistics in 2019 from Worcester Polytechnic institute (WPI). After that I joined a healthcare company for prototyping and developing predictive model for decision support utilizing different data resources. My research involves specifically on Bayesian survey methodology, small area estimation and survey sampling. My expertise is in Bayesian hierarchical modeling and I am also interest in Bayesian methods in a broad field of applications.
