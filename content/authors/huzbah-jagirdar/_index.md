 I am a MSc Epidemiology student at McGill University, where I completed my undergraduate studies in Honours Economics with a minor in Computer Science.  My work involves assessing the viability and characterising the performance of fully and semi-tailored minimum inter-donation intervals policies for blood donors using operational data. I am interested in inter-disciplinary problem solving, the impact of health and social policies, and the applications of data science and machine learning in health and economic research.
