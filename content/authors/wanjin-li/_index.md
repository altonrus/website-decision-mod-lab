I am a MScPH student at McGill University and completed my undergraduate study at Western University with an honour specialization in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. For my practicum project in summer 2022, I am assessing the impact of the Opal patient portal on operational outcomes at the Cedars Cancer Center. I am passionate about performing quantitative analyses to solve real-world problems in the healthcare field and exploring the intersection of computer science, data science, and public health.
